We have spent years dedicated towards advancing education for those who
have fallen in love with technology. This ambition has driven us to administer courses for secondary and post-secondary school students, collaborate with non-profit organizations to provide resources and experience to underprivileged students, and organize events for students in the Philippines. 

Our manifesto follows 3 basic principles: listen, collaborate, and be patient. 

Listen. Our instinct is often to start something new. What we really need to do is find people who are already working on these problems... listen to them... and see what's possible through our support.

Collaborate. We tend to work in silos. What we really need to do is make it easier for organizations, government, and others to come together and drive impact.

Be patient. We are so focused on what's possible in 1 year, 2 years, 3 years. In reality, the issues we face are far more complex. What we really need to be doing is looking at 5 years, 10 years, and beyond to scale impact in a meaningful way.
