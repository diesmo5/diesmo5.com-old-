Putting education and the youth on a pedestal for the future, Hack Iloilo successfully launches garnering the participation of 146 students and 15 mentors from the local Iloilo community. Several of the nearby institutions such as the Central Philippine University, Iloilo State College of Fisheries, University of Iloilo, and Dumangas National High School decided to compete and showcase their passion and skills in software development.

There was notable participation from Central Philippine University Iloilo and Dumangas National High School.

CPU's very own Beta Sigma fraternity was exclusively responsible for providing students who could volunteer for the full duration of the event. With over 160 attendees to manage, Beta Sigma's efforts behind the scenes were certainly of great benefit towards keeping the event on track. Additionally, 60% of the competitors came from CPU's class of software engineers, computer engineers, information technologists, and computer scientists who were coached by their very own professors. Central Philippine University students certainly displayed their ability to develop high level software architecture and mobile applications by taking home the gold.

Dumangas National High School partnered with event coordinator, Dwight Diesmo, and Dumangas politician, Butch Suspene, to provide high school students the rare opportunity of learning in a heightened educational atmosphere. Counselor Suspene and Dumangas' local businessman Antonio Diesmo Jr. organized field trip transportation by providing buses and taxi services to take 40 high school students and teachers from Dumangas to Iloilo for the event. At the event, students got to work along side university students and professors giving them a better sense of insight for higher education. Dwight Diesmo also hosted a workshop teaching the students and teachers modern web development using React JS and Bootstrap 4. In the end, the high school students came home with their very own website.

Later that evening, teams presented their works to a panel of judges prominently featuring, Founder of NewCo Foundation and former CEO of Connexity, Dave Gross who flew in just for Hack Iloilo. Dave Gross was the platinum benefactor of the event providing full sponsorship for event T-Shirts, catering from Antoy's Native Lechon Manok, and the grand sum for the cash prize.

Hack Iloilo rewarded 1st Place Winners with ₱25,000, 2nd Place Winners with ₱15,000, and 3rd Place Winners with ₱10,000.

Third place went to Science Revieword by Aliza Mariz Jolo, Mark Lunel Demagajes, Roi Pachica, and Keira Dale Jacinto. The current state of education in the Philippines, sadly involves limited resources. Classrooms often had one textbook to share among a class of 30-40 students. Contextualizing the fact that most students happen to have a smartphone, Aliza, Mark, Roj, and Keira hoped to build a website that digitally houses textbooks allowing every student the ability to have their textbooks in their pockets.

Second place went to Angel Lou Baladjay, Nereo Jr. Valeriano, and John Dominic Lagarde for building StudyGo. StudyGo aims to build a larger study community among Filipino students. The app allows students to create and advertise their study groups and opens them up to nearby newcomers looking for peers to study with.

First place went to Jules Nathaniel Perez and Renzo Alfonso for their project Wordnite which templates the way students and teachers write word documents. Currently, thousands of paper is easily wasted at schools when students fail to comply with the formatting set by their teachers. This mistake is easily made since different teachers have different preferences on style so its easy for students to confuse or mistake their teachers' desired format. Even at the slightest error like font size or misplaced comma, the paper is immediately torn and tossed into the trash. Wordnite allows teachers to set the format and students can just login and type their essay into the template.
