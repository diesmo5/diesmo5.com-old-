Good with his head and his fists, Dwight kept a 3.8 grade-point average in his senior year, earning an academic award of excellence. The 17-year-old also holds a black belt in taekwondo and won a gold medal from the World Taekwondo Federation.

The son of Antonio and Ellen Diesmo, Dwight mentors other kids in coding through the NewCoding Bootcamp.

“We teach kids all aspects of coding, from building games to making applications,” the future engineering student said.

He also organized and led Rancho Campana students in several coding competitions, including Hackathon by the Sea and Startup Weekend Ventura, where Dwight helped students develop ideas for apps and startups.

This fall, Dwight will enroll at San Diego State University, where he will major in engineering at SDSU’s Weber Honors College, minoring in interdisciplinary studies, he said. Teacher Brianna Davis was Dwight’s favorite instructor at Rancho Campana, he said, because she was always willing to talk and share advice.

His dad has had the biggest impact on his life, Dwight said.

“He’ll work around his busy work schedule to come to every event, and in times of need somehow he always knows what to do,” the teen said. A decade from now, Dwight hopes he’ll be the president of his own startup using the computer skills he acquired through education.
