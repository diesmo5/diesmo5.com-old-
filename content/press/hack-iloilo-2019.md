Dwight's poverty filled upbringing from the Philippines filled him with immense gratitude years after moving to America. The Diesmo family found themselves on a plane to the U.S. after Antonio Diesmo, Dwight's father found a job as a registered nurse in Memphis, Tennessee. Since then, they've been able to progress from their homeless pass to their middle-class life. Dwight never thought much of his family's status, but he came to realize that if they had never moved to the U.S. then they would've spent the rest of their lives struggling.

It was America's abundance in opportunity coupled with Antonio's hard work and ambition that they were able to advance in economic status. Dwight Diesmo now sees another opportunity, this time, it is not in nursing, it is in technology.

"One day, countries of great wealth will desperately need young and bright minds in the field of technology. Computer scientists, software engineers, and computer engineers will be needed during our worlds' advancements in technology in the form of voice, virtual reality, renewable energy, and its quest to journey the depths of space. My dream is that one day, the Philippines will be ready to answer that call." - Dwight Anthony Diesmo | <i>Speech at Iloilo State College of Fisheries - Dumangas </i>

On August 21 of 2019, Dwight Diesmo took his first step towards this dream by organizing Hack Iloilo alongside <a href="https://www.newco.foundation/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">NewCo Foundation</a> and Beta Sigma Fraternity - Central Philippines University Iloilo.

Hack Iloilo is a hackathon open to all undergraduate and graduate students in Iloilo. This included 100 students from Central Philippines University, University of Iloilo, and Iloilo State College of Fisheries.

On top of that, Dwight partnered with local Dumangas politician, Butch Suspene, to organize a field trip for 40 special science/honors students and 10 teachers from Dumangas National High School. Dwight thought that this would inspire them to pursue their interests in technology through formal education as well as value extracurricular endeavors beyond the typical classroom setting.
