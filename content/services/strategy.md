title1: Positioning
text1: Positioning is the heart of a brand. It defines what a brand is, its benefits and competitive advantages, and what it means to the target market. In short, brand positioning establishes an emotional connection with your customers. It’s how you want your company to be perceived in their minds and among competitors.

title2: User Profiles and Journeys
text2: We apply our findings from customer segmentation to user profiles that represent a brand’s target markets, then map out scenarios in which those users might interact with a brand. Defining informed interactions helps us predict pain points and provides insight into functionality and user behavior.
