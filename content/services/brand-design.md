                  We believe in creating marks that are appropriate for the industry that our clients are in. We also believe in creating marks that will endure the test of time. We accomplish this by keeping marks simple, making it versatile. Marks that are versatile are not constricted to how they are used. Whether they are used in websites, social media, app icons, or flyers, logos should be applicable across all platforms without sacrificing readability or quality. Versatility also includes culture in the sense that logos should not be based on trends that do not last. Logos should last over time and should actually have the ability to communicate across different cultures. This is why we design using the logo system.
