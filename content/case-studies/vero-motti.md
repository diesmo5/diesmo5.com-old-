headline: Reimagine. Reinvent. Change.
overview: Vero Motti is a brand strategist that helps businesses rethink their approach to sustainability, so they can cultivate a more transparent and real relationship with customers.

challenge: From an early age, Vero learned how being a vegetarian could have a positive impact on the environment. It became natural to her to inspire people to live and consume more consciously, so she decided to niche down her work as a copywriter and strategist to only help business with environmentalists concerns.
outcome: diesmo5 helped Veronica communicate her passion and story by designing her brand identity. 

header1: In between the classic and modern
text1: "The identity captures the organic and elegant essence of Veroâ€™s personal brand. The refined typographic logo is set in Bodoni*, and a vibrant lime green brings energy to the earthy colors of the palette. A questioner and confident tone of voice informs the audience about environmental issues and aims to foment discussions about it."

header3: Keeping things minimal
text3: "The minimalist, organic look of the brand extends to the website design. One of the visual guidelines was to use as little white color as possible so the variety of the identity palette could be explored. Visit: https://www.veromotti.com/"
