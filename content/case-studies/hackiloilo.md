headline: Improving Education. Promoting Practical Experience. Establishing a Presence.
overview: Hack Iloilo is an annual event open to high school and university students in Iloilo, Philippines. This is a joint mission led by NewCo Foundation and DIESMO 5 to provide project-based learning opportunities in the field of information technology incentivising the youth to combining their skills in engineering with entrepreneurship with the hopes that maybe one day they'll be responsible for building the next piece of innovative technology that enhances the livlihood in the Philippines and countries similar around the world.

challenge: Establishing a genuine proffessional presence and communicating in a way contextual to the filipino culture.
outcome: DIESMO 5 helped build a brand identity and presence with the people of Iloilo's values, diction, and culture in mind.

header1: Gaining Context
text1: "An important part in our process is gaining context of the situation. This means understanding the needs of our client (NewCo Foundation), the goals of the event, the culture, attitudem and values of the Iloilo community. One of the things we did involved extensive research and recon during the month of January 2019 in the form of visiting as many local universities as we could. Our purpose of doing this was: to understand the current state of education in the Philippines for subjects regarding information technology (What computer languages, frameworks, and subjects are taught in the classroom?); to grasp a sense of the entrepreneurial and engineering culture (What opportunities or resources are available to students to advance their education and careers?); and to be aware of what tools are available for us to execute the event (What venue, computers, internet, and volunteers are available at our disposal?). During this process Iloilo State College of Fisheries invited us to speak to their seniors studying computer science to guage their level of interest as well as understand what aspects of the event would benefit them in the long run. One of the things we came to understand was the level of importance of certificates. Apparently, certificates are one of the strongest differentiators when acquiring a job so we made it an essential component of the event."

header2: Building an Identity
text2: "Once we acquired a good understanding of the situation, we were able to develop an appropriate approach to building an identity that would resonate with the target audience. The logo that we designed for this event is a sun housed by two arrows. The arrows are iconic in the field of computer science, it is commonly used when creating tags in hyper text markup languages. The sun is the exact same as the sun on the Philippine Flag. We thought this was perfect for building a community of Filipino Software Developers."

header3: Developing the Website
text3: "Since Hack Iloilo is introducing an event that the Philippines had never seen before, we found it important to keep things simple. When developing the website, it was important to communicate the why and how on one page. The site also had to perform two different tasks. First, the website had to perform as a marketing funnel that allowed customers register to the event. Second, the website had to act as a tool on the day of the event where workshop leads could post links or event coordinators could post announcements. Visit: https://hackiloilo.com"

header4: The Results
text4: The event turned to be a success. Over a hundred people pre-registered online and 40 more walk-ins the day of the event totalling 146 students competitors and mentors. The brand design and website is also going to be reused for the upcoming events but the event coordinators will use our CMS (content management system) to continuously update the sites content and information.
