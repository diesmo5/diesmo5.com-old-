headline: Reduce. Reuse. Recycle
overview: Green Bubble International is a non-profit organization that promotes and builds green life communities. They work with neighborhoods, school clubs, and other non-profits to build large "bubbles" of people who take care of their environment.

challenge: Creating a modern look and feel that resonates with the youth and effectively communicates in the modern world.
outcome: DIESMO 5 helped build a renovated image that pays respects to the work the organization has done in the past and successfully helps them operate in the now.

header1: Understanding the Purpose
text1: "With an organization that has been in the game for so long, it's important to understand where they're coming from. Why the need for such a big change? Apparently, GBI has had great success with partnerships in third world countries helping the locals rid their towns of trash, helping them recycle, and building irrigation systems in some. But in first world countries, they've felt irrelevant and find it nearly impossible to get the youth excited about helping their own communities. With a new brand presence, GBI hopes to build their relationships with high school students by establishing service clubs who will focus on keeping their bubbles green and of course, provide scholarship opportunities to the most active student members."

header2: A New Image
text2: "We started this design by compiling a list of companies in the same sector to get a general understanding of their branding. This helps us make decisions that keep the style fit appropriately with that niche while staying unique. One concept that stuck with us is bubbles driven by people who care. So we tackled this by creating a green bubble for start and added an abstraction on the inside. Typically when we see bubble illustrations we see a darker portion within the bubble to create a 3D look to it. We chose to make this abstraction resemble a heart to represent the caring people within those green bubbles."

header3: Developing the Website
text3: "Since Hack Iloilo is introducing an event that the Philippines had never seen before, we found it important to keep things simple. When developing the website, it was important to communicate the why and how on one page. The site also had to perform two different tasks. First, the website had to perform as a marketing funnel that allowed customers register to the event. Second, the website had to act as a tool on the day of the event where workshop leads could post links or event coordinators could post announcements. Visit: https://hackiloilo.com"

header4: The Results
text4: The event turned to be a success. Over a hundred people pre-registered online and 40 more walk-ins the day of the event totalling 146 students competitors and mentors. The brand design and website is also going to be reused for the upcoming events but the event coordinators will use our CMS (content management system) to continuously update the sites content and information.
