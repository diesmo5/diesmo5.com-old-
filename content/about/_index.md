description: DIESMO 5 STORY
---

Our story is not about overnight success nor is it about the glitz and glamour of entrepreneurship and engineering. Our story began many years ago in Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines.

For the first six years of my life, my family struggled through poverty. My dad spent every day and night working to keep our family afloat. One of the things he would do is go to agencies that were working with hospitals in the U.S. in hope of finding a job as a nurse. It took 6 years before a seat opened and off we went, June of 2006.

Moving to the U.S. was certainly far from being smooth. We shared a home with my aunt's family in San Diego, while my dad was off working in Memphis. Quickly, he made enough money where he felt as if he could comfortably support our family. It was then that we got to live together again. A few months pass and he finds a job in Camarillo. A few years pass and his title and salary increases. Eventually, we find ourselves living in a good neighborhood, in a gated community, and we had all the time in the world to hang with one another.

In 2013, we fly to the Philippines for my grandmother's funeral. When we touched down, all the memories I had rushed back at me. The streets I used to play on, the carts in the community center where I would buy street food from, and my house that we used to live in.

Out of nowhere, I felt extremely greatful for the fact that my family was able to migrate to the U.S. That transition opened doors of opportunity that would have never existed if we had stayed in the Philippines. There, I also saw my dad giving back to the locals, supporting the church from his childhood, and bringing gifts to the students in the community.
